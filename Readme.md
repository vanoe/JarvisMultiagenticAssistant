# ü§ñ Jarvis ‚Äì Multiagentic Assistant

**Next-generation multi-agent conversational assistant**  
Unlike typical single-agent AI assistants, Jarvis coordinates **multiple specialized agents**‚Äîsuch as calendar, summarizer, and memory‚Äîthrough a central reasoning system.

---

## üåü Key Features

- **Emotional Intelligence:** Analyzes voice tone to adapt responses, making conversations feel natural and human
- **Persistent Memory:** Recalls past interactions to personalize future responses
- **Multiagent Coordination:** Handles multiple tasks simultaneously with a reasoning backbone

---

## üîπ Problem Solved

Most AI assistants struggle with:

- Single-agent limitations
- Poor emotional awareness
- Difficulty managing complex conversations and task switching

Jarvis addresses these challenges with **task-specific agents, emotional intelligence, and real-time voice processing**.

---

## üí° Solution & Achievements

Jarvis is built on **Hume AI** and integrates multiagent orchestration, real-time voice interaction, and persistent memory.

**Achievements:**

- Multiagent orchestration with **LangChain** and **Mistral** for real-time reasoning
- Integration with **Hume Empathic Voice API** for emotion-adaptive behavior
- Full voice interface using **Google STT/TTS** with <400ms latency via WebRTC
- Persistent memory stored in **PostgreSQL** for long-term context and personalization
